# Kalman_Filter_for_Multiple_Object_Tracking_(MOT)


####"Kalman filters are recursive algorithms used to estimate the state of a linear dynamic system. 
In the context of MOT, Kalman filters can be used to predict the future state (position, velocity, ..etc) of each object based on its previous states and measurements, even in the presence of noisy or incomplete data."
